**Empowering Citizens. Enhancing Cities.**

## 🌍 Problem We Are Solving

Civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, garbage dumps, and waterlogging continue to plague urban India. Despite digital platforms, citizens find it difficult to **report**, **track**, and **get updates** on issues in real-time. Problems remain unresolved for weeks, and authorities struggle to prioritize and verify complaints.

> 🧠 According to a 2023 study by Praja Foundation:
> - 68% of citizens do not know how to report civic problems
> - 45% are dissatisfied with the grievance redressal process
> - Over 70% of complaints go unresolved for more than 10 days
